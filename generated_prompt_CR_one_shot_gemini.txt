SELECT CountryCode, Language FROM countrylanguage ORDER BY Percentage DESC; This query doesn't directly answer "What is the language spoken by the largest percentage of people in each country?" because it returns all languages ordered by percentage, not just the single highest percentage language for each country. To get the single highest percentage language per country, we need a more sophisticated query using window functions (which SQLite doesn't directly support). However, we can approximate this using a subquery and a `LIMIT` clause, which is less efficient but works in SQLite: SELECT T1.CountryCode, T1.Language FROM countrylanguage AS T1 INNER JOIN ( SELECT CountryCode, MAX(Percentage) AS MaxPercentage FROM countrylanguage GROUP BY CountryCode ) AS T2 ON T1.CountryCode = T2.CountryCode AND T1.Percentage = T2.MaxPercentage; This query works by: 1. **Inner Subquery:** This finds the maximum percentage for each country. 2. **Outer Query:** This joins the results of the subquery back to the `countrylanguage` table to retrieve the language corresponding to that maximum percentage. If multiple languages share the same maximum percentage for a country, this query will return all of them. If you need to handle ties differently (e.g., only return one language arbitrarily in case of ties), you might need to add more complex logic, potentially involving row numbers or other techniques that are not directly supported in SQLite's standard SQL dialect. The above solution provides a reasonable approximation within SQLite's limitations.
